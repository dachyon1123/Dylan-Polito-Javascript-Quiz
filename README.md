# Dylan-Polito-Javascript-Quiz

This project was created for UT Austin Bootcamp. This project helped me better unstand WebAPi's as well as objects. It also helped me understand how to better coordinate multiple functions that all work together. The project is a simple javascript quiz. There is about 50 questions that will be randomly presented. After answering right 2 extra seconds will be added. After answering wrong, 5 seconds will be subtracted. At the end you can save your initials and high score.
